## üîß How It Works

1. **User Input**:
   - On running the script, you're prompted:
     ```
     Are you entering a dish name or ingredients? Type 'dish' or 'ingredients':
     ```
   - Based on your choice:
     - **If 'dish'**: Enter the name of a specific dish (e.g., "Mirzaghasemi").
     - **If 'ingredients'**: Enter ingredients one by one (e.g., egg, eggplant, tomato, garlic), finishing with `done`.

2. **Text Generation (via GPT-3.5)**:
   - A custom prompt is generated for GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct to produce:
     - A brief background or cultural origin
     - A recipe title (prefixed with ‚ÄúRecipe Title:‚Äù)
     - A numbered list of cooking steps
     - A list of ingredients (if relevant)

3. **Image Generation (via DALL¬∑E)**:
   - A detailed image prompt is constructed from the recipe text and sent to DALL¬∑E.
   - The AI generates a high-quality, food magazine-style image of the final dish.

4. **Output Files**:
   - A `.txt` file with the full recipe
   - A `.jpg` file with the AI-generated dish image
